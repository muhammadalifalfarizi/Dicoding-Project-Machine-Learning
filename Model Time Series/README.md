# Gold Price Prediction using LSTM

This code demonstrates how to train a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to predict gold prices.
The code reads gold price data from a CSV file, preprocesses the data, builds an LSTM model, and trains it using a windowed dataset approach.
The model is optimized using early stopping based on Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and uses the Huber loss function.
